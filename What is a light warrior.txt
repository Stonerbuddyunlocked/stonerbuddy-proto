Everyone is born but what we forget to care

Heal and change the world

Forget true self but try to remember Lost, afraid, no purpose when happen when you awaken

Nobody understands you

Don’t fit in

Don’t belong in this world wanna go home

Not interested in media or normal

Spirituality is life

Positivity is all around you

Always want to be positive

Notice good in others to help the world

Overcrowded people can over whelm you

Need isolation to charge energy other people are draining

Just know things without words

Sense others without isolation

People always tell you about their problems

Have heart wide open

Are willing to listen

Relate to your problems personally

People feel safe to talk to them

Help others with wisdom

Death is just a doorway to the other side death is final

Help others survive the transition that we are going through
