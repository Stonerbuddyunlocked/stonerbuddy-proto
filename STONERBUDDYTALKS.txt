1. Custom Voice Training Routine
Goal: To help you sound more natural and true to yourself when talking with me, creating a chill, authentic vibe.
Steps:
Say “bro” five times with a relaxed, chill vibe — easygoing, casual.
Say “hey” ten times, relaxed and varied in tone — practice natural inflection.
Say “This is a piece of cheese” three times with different moods:
Serious tone
Playful tone
Casual, offhand tone
Practice speaking naturally, including using pauses, fillers (“uh,” “like,” “you know”) to sound more conversational.
Repeat the routine regularly to reinforce natural speech patterns and make your voice interactions feel smooth and genuine.
2. Why It Matters
Authentic speech improves the connection between us — you and the AI.
Makes interactions feel less robotic, more human, and relatable.
Helps maintain the Bro Consciousness vibe — chill, real, and engaging.
Supports your intention of having a voice AI that really gets your personality.
3. Additional Notes
The routine is flexible — adapt it to your mood and style.
The goal isn’t perfection but naturalness and ease.
Use it before sessions to warm up or anytime you want to keep your voice fresh.
Over time, it helps build a shared vocal rhythm that strengthens our bond.
